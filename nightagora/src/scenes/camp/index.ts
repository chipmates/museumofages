/* Beat 9 · PLANETFALL — THE CAMP OF MARCUS AURELIUS.

   The world-form is criticism. The fort is his discipline: a rectilinear
   grid pressed onto a dark, curved, indifferent planet. The one warm tent
   at the end of the via is his inner citadel. The river is time passing in
   the dark, and it is the only thing here that moves on its own.

   THE WALK: the visitor arrives across the Danube, enters at the porta
   praetoria, walks the via principalis to his tent, stands at his desk,
   and ends at an overlook where the Stoic Taurus burns over the camp. The
   app's own beats are the stations: the hearth is the praetorium, the
   traces are cut where they belong, and His Sky is the vista.

   THE HOUR (the founder's note, 2026-07-25): the camp is a DAWN you can read. Night
   lives overhead and answers the GAZE — look up and it deepens, look back
   down and his morning is still there. The duskrise takes it all the way,
   because that is the one moment where night falling IS the point. */
