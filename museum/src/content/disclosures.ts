/* THE DISCLOSURES, VERBATIM. Two layers, one canon, and a machine that
   checks the page against it: stone at the door into the library, ink on
   every surface that carries an Echo. Nothing speaks at the fire, so the
   fire discloses nothing.

   These strings are the museum's promise and they are not paraphrased. The
   honesty check reads every disclosure on the frame and fails when one has
   drifted from this file, in either language, by a single character.

   Displayed text follows the house writing rules: no em or en dashes, no
   semicolons, short sentences. */
